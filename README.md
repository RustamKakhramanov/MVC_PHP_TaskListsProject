# MVC_PHP_TaskListsProject
Implementation registration on the site, creating a task, previewing the task, attaching an image to the task, automatically reducing the task image with a large size, updating the task body, changing the task status. In order to edit the task you need to have the role of an administrator. For simplicity, I created an exported Login: admin, password: admin.
